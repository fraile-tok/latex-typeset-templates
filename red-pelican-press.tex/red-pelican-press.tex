    {n times long-forgotten} lived, by the Sea, a Man who cared not about gold and riches, nor fame and glory. His attention, instead, was fully invested in escaping from Death. Such an obsession filled his days and his nights. He ceased not in his efforts, and his home by the Sea was soon occupied by a never-ending collection of machines and contraptions to aid him in his goal.


    So engrossed he was in this matter that he did not hear the Sea sing its warnings nor saw the Storm forming around him. When it all finally fell upon his house by the Sea, he could do nothing but stand and watch as, together, the furies of the Sea and the Sky engorged and destroyed everything that stood in their way. He rushed behind it all, to no avail.


    It was in this way that, by the raging Sea, he realized that he had failed: he would die. This epiphany would have sufficed to destroy the last remnants of his spirits had it not been for another revelation; equally true but profoundly sweeter: it was because that he would die that he would, finally, live.
