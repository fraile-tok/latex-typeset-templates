	\large{\textit{Gerard Manley Hopkins}}
	
	\vspace{12pt}
	
	As kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame;
	
	As tumbled over rim in roundy wells	
	
	Stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's	
	
	Bow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name;	
	
	Each mortal thing does one thing and the same:
	
	Deals out that being indoors each one dwells;	
	
	Selves — goes itself; myself it speaks and spells,
	
	Crying Whát I dó is me: for that I came.
	
	\vspace{12pt}	

	I say móre: the just man justices;	
	
	Keeps grace: thát keeps all his goings graces;	
	
	Acts in God's eye what in God's eye he is —	
	
	Chríst — for Christ plays in ten thousand places,
	
	Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his
	
	To the Father through the features of men's faces.

	Glory be to God for dappled things –

    \quad For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;

    \quad\quad For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;

	Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches’ wings;

    \quad Landscape plotted and pieced – fold, fallow, and plough;

    \quad\quad And áll trádes, their gear and tackle and trim.

	\vspace{12pt}

	All things counter, original, spare, strange;

    \quad Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)

    \quad\quad With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;

	He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:

    \quad\quad\quad\quad Praise Him.

	\textit{To Christ our Lord}
	
	\vspace{12pt}
	I caught this morning morning's minion, king-

    \quad dom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding

    \quad Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding

	High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing

	In his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,

    \quad As a skate's heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding

    \quad Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding

	Stirred for a bird, – the achieve of, the mastery of the thing!
	
	\vspace{12pt}
	Brute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here

    \quad Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion

	Times told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!

	\vspace{12pt}
    \quad No wonder of it: shéer plód makes plough down sillion

	Shine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,

    \quad Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermilion.
